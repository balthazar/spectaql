# Spectaql

> A simple documentation generator for GraphQL endpoints

### Purpose

Contrary to dociql (which inspired this project), Spectaql aims to make it as
seemless as possible to generate a documentation without having to write useless
config parameters which increase technical debt since you would have to tweak it
if a modification was made in your resolvers.

### Install

```bash
yarn global add spectaql
```

### Usage

Look at the example config, yo.

```bash
spectaql config.yml
```
